# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Analysis of MLS Teams and Stadium Locations

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How does the geographic distribution of MLS stadiums correlate with team performance and fan attendance?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The geographic distribution of sports teams can offer unique insights into regional support, potential market gaps, and logistical considerations for leagues. This project focuses on Major League Soccer (MLS) in the USA, examining the locations of the teams' stadiums and their capacities. By analyzing the provided data, we aim to understand how the location of stadiums affects team performance and fan attendance. We will use geospatial analysis, alongside statistical methods, to find correlations and trends that can provide valuable insights for league organizers and team management.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefix "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
